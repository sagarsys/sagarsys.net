Architected and built a React platform enabling social media creators to launch their bol affiliate storefronts—focusing on user & developer experiences, and guiding a backend-focused team through their first React production environment.

**Key Achievements:**

- **Team enablement**: Mentored backend developers on React through hands-on sessions, code reviews, and pair programming
- **GitLab CI automation**: Built deployment pipelines to enforce code quality standards
- **Cross-team collaboration**: Partnered with platform team to refine the newly ported React component library—first production implementation
- **UX innovation**: Collaborated with designers to fine-tune user experiences; gathered alpha user feedback and iterated rapidly
