Building and innovating internal tools that empower non-technical teams at iO. Gathering requirements directly from stakeholders, I design and deliver solutions that solve real problems—while pushing boundaries with AI-augmented interfaces. In between, I also worked as support on client projects such as Philips Evnia and level up my skills.

**Key Achievements:**

- Integrated AI agents (LLMs) directly into UIs to enhance platform capabilities
- Full ownership from discovery to deployment
- Continuous learning culture: Frontend Masters certifications, workshops, conferences, and knowledge sharing through blog posts
- Complex CSS animations for Philips EVNIA

**Continuous Learning:**

- Regular attendee at tech meetups and conferences across the Netherlands
- Certifications from Frontend Masters, Egghead.io, Udemy
- Share knowledge through blog posts on iO's Tech Hub: <https://techhub.iodigital.com/author/sagar-sawuck>
