## Overview

PubliSpeak is the first PDF document virtualization solution that is fully
accessible (compliant with the WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards). It uses
patented technology that extracts content from a standard PDF file to convert it
into HTML support that fits any screen.

## My Role

Together with a team of 3 developers and a CTO, our role was to migrate an older
flash version of PubliSpeak to modern web technologies, accessible across
multiple devices (screen sizes) and within accessibility standards. As a senior
frontend developer, my task was to use CSS3 and Angular to make this work, while
interacting with and integrating the backend APIs.

## Key Challenges

-   **Accessibility First**: Due to accessibility requirements, we could not use
    existing plugins/libraries. This implied developing our own in-house
    libraries, such as an infinite scroll engine, a carousel, and others.

-   **Multi-tenant Platform**: Each client could customize the platform to match
    their branding. I had to introduce CSS variables to change the look and feel
    of the whole platform.

-   **Performance Optimization**: Some PDFs are 500+ pages long. The infinite
    scroll engine was responsible for switching between image representation to
    HTML view for pages in focus, with lazy loading of HTML chunks.

-   **Fully Responsive Design**: Focus on UI/UX coupled with strict
    accessibility constraints.

-   **Team Growth**: Formation and training of junior developers as the company
    expanded.
