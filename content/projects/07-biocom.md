## Overview

Founded in 1995, Biocom is a wholesale distributor of pharmaceutical products in Mauritius, the region, and its global network of healthcare professionals. Biocom's major clients involve medical organizations, pharmacies, governmental, and embodied institutions.

The website represents a complete digital transformation for a company that had been operating for 25 years, requiring a rebranding to transition to the web while maintaining their core values of simplicity and professionalism.

## My Role

As a fullstack developer and designer, my role was to assist the client from start to finish throughout the project's lifecycle: conception, prototyping, design, content recommendation, development, deployment, hosting, optimization & SEO (Search Engine Optimization), and accessibility.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Complete project lifecycle management from conception to deployment
- Brand identity design and digital transformation strategy
- Full-stack development using React, Next.js, and Material UI
- AWS infrastructure setup (S3 + CloudFront) for global performance
- SEO optimization and accessibility compliance
- Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation

## Key Challenges

- **Brand Identity Creation**: Project was started from scratch. Biocom has been operating for 25 years and needed a rebranding to transition to the web. It was both challenging and fun to figure out how to tell their brand story effectively - with the principle guideline from the director - simplicity. We went through a lot of brainstorming in order to create a digital identity for Biocom.

- **Modern React Architecture**: React was used as the UI framework in order to create the subtle user interactions on the website. React Material UI complements this choice by giving the website a clean look. Also note that from a technical perspective, the website uses the latest React hook APIs.

- **Static Site Optimization**: In order to make the website as lightweight as possible, it was pre-rendered and statically hosted. This implies careful use of browser APIs within the source code.

- **Contact Form Integration**: A contact form within the static website was an issue that needed to be resolved. This required creative solutions to handle form submissions without a traditional backend.

- **Global Performance**: The website is hosted on an AWS S3 bucket, and cached/served by worldwide AWS CloudFront distributions to optimize load times for viewers throughout the world.

- **Web Standards & Accessibility**: The website has a score of 80+ on Google Lighthouse - it is optimized to modern web standards, including accessibility, SEO, and PWA (Progressive Web App).

- **Cross-Platform Testing**: Responsive design and extreme focus on user experience (UX) across devices and platforms - heavy testing on mobile phones, tablets and desktop, on Windows, Mac, Android & iPhone (Safari, IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera).

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: React JS with Material UI, Next.js for static generation
- **Styling**: CSS Preprocessor (SCSS) for maintainable stylesheets
- **Infrastructure**: AWS S3 for hosting, CloudFront for global CDN
- **APIs**: Google Maps API integration
- **Performance**: 80+ Lighthouse score, PWA capabilities
- **Accessibility**: WCAG compliant, optimized for all users

## Impact

- Successfully rebranded a 25-year-old company for the digital age
- Created a modern, accessible, and performant web presence
- Achieved 80+ Lighthouse score across all metrics
- Implemented global CDN for optimal performance worldwide
- Delivered a complete solution from design to deployment
