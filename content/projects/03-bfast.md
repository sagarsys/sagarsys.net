## Overview

Desktop-based "mini-game" applications for interactive kiosks. Applications
developed around data collection concept. Users participate in mini-games for a
chance to win prizes while agreeing to submit data or answer survey questions.
Collected data is extracted for marketing purposes.

## My Role

As a fullstack developer, I participated in the full lifecycle of the project -
from design to deployment & support. Together with my frontend colleague, we
chose the tech stack and developed a generic reusable library for quick
application building.

Responsibilities:

-   Full application development (frontend + backend)
-   Remote deployment and testing on kiosks
-   Live support and debugging
-   Data export in CSV format

## Key Challenges

-   **Remote Debugging**: Live support worldwide, working odd hours due to
    timezone differences
-   **Tactile UI/UX**: No physical keyboard, designed emulated keyboard
    interface
-   **Peripheral Devices**: Integration with printers, QR/barcode scanners
-   **Admin Interface**: Hidden mechanism to access administration for
    debugging, reprinting tickets, exporting data
-   **Deployment**: Standard process to build and deploy Electron app with
    required peripheral device drivers
-   **Tight Deadlines**: Applications delivered for specific events (Christmas,
    festivals) with no room for delays
