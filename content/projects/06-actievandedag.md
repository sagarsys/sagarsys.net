## Overview

Actievandedag is a high-traffic eCommerce platform built with React and Next.js, serving millions of users daily. The platform focuses on delivering exceptional user experiences through optimized performance, engaging interfaces, and seamless shopping experiences.

## My Role

As a Full-stack JavaScript Developer at Talpa eCommerce, I worked on React/Next.js development for this high-traffic eCommerce platform. My focus was on enhancing user engagement, optimizing performance, and improving developer productivity across the team.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Developed and maintained React/Next.js frontend features for millions of users
- Built REST APIs using Fastify and Node.js for seamless backend integration
- Optimized application performance to handle high traffic loads
- Migrated codebase to new React versions while maintaining zero downtime
- Improved code maintainability and developer experience across the team
- Managed cloud infrastructure deployments on AWS using Docker and Kubernetes
- Implemented comprehensive Jest test suites for code reliability

## Key Challenges

- **High-Traffic Performance**: Optimizing React/Next.js application to handle millions of users with minimal latency and maximum uptime. This required careful attention to code splitting, lazy loading, and efficient state management.

- **Code Maintainability**: Improving code quality and developer experience across the team while maintaining fast delivery cycles. Introduced best practices, code reviews, and reusable component libraries.

- **Full-Stack Integration**: Building REST APIs with Fastify/Node.js that seamlessly integrate with React frontend features. Ensured consistent data flow and error handling across the stack.

- **React Migration**: Successfully migrating to new React versions while maintaining backward compatibility and zero downtime. This involved careful planning, incremental updates, and thorough testing.

- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Managing deployments on AWS with Docker and Kubernetes for scalable, reliable operations. Implemented CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for automated deployments.

- **Testing & Quality**: Implementing comprehensive Jest test suites to ensure code reliability and prevent regressions. Achieved high test coverage while maintaining development velocity.

## Technical Highlights

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Redux for state management
- **Backend**: Fastify, Node.js for REST API development
- **Testing**: Jest for comprehensive test coverage
- **Infrastructure**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes for scalable deployments
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated workflows
- **Performance**: Optimized for high-traffic scenarios with millions of users

## Impact

- Enhanced UX and performance, driving higher user engagement
- Improved code maintainability and developer experience across the team
- Built robust REST APIs alongside frontend features for seamless integration
- Successfully migrated to new React versions with zero downtime
- Established scalable cloud infrastructure for reliable operations
