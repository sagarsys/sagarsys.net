## What Drives Me

Beyond writing code, I'm passionate about **discovering people, creativity, nature, conservation, healthy living, science, sustainability, renewable energy, and humanitarianism**. I believe technology should serve a greater purpose—which is why I'm excited about opportunities that align innovation with positive environmental impact.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me **hiking, exploring nature, art and culture, diving into psychology and quantum physics, or practicing yoga and mindfulness**. I enjoy sharing my photography with people to make them more conscious of the beauty of nature, in the hope that they protect it for ourselves and future generations. **#SaveSoil**
