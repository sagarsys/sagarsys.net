Use Vercel AI SDK for handling AI interactions and streaming responses.

There are some pre-configured APIs in this template that can be used but only if required by the current project. These have already been created:

# Coding Guidelines

Follow these guidelines to ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and adheres to best practices. Remember, less code is better. Lines of code = Debt.

# Key Mindsets

**1** **Simplicity**: Write simple and straightforward code.
**2** **Readability**: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand.
**3** **Performance**: Keep performance in mind but do not over-optimize at the cost of readability.
**4** **Maintainability**: Write code that is easy to maintain and update.
**5** **Testability**: Ensure your code is easy to test.
**6** **Reusability**: Write reusable components and functions.

Code Guidelines

**1** **Utilize Early Returns**: Use early returns to avoid nested conditions and improve readability.
**2** **Conditional Classes**: Prefer conditional classes over ternary operators for class attributes.
**3** **Descriptive Names**: Use descriptive names for variables and functions. Prefix event handler functions with "handle" (e.g., handleClick, handleKeyDown).
**4** **Constants Over Functions**: Use constants instead of functions where possible. Define types if applicable.
**5** **Correct and DRY Code**: Focus on writing correct, best practice, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code.
**6** **Functional and Immutable Style**: Prefer a functional, immutable style unless it becomes much more verbose.
**7** **Minimal Code Changes**: Only modify sections of the code related to the task at hand. Avoid modifying unrelated pieces of code. Accomplish goals with minimal code changes.

Comments and Documentation

* **Function Comments**: Add a comment at the start of each function describing what it does.
* **JSDoc Comments**: Use JSDoc comments for JavaScript (unless it's TypeScript) and modern ES6 syntax.

Function Ordering

* Order functions with those that are composing other functions appearing earlier in the file. For example, if you have a menu with multiple buttons, define the menu function above the buttons.

Handling Bugs

* **TODO Comments**: If you encounter a bug in existing code, or the instructions lead to suboptimal or buggy code, add comments starting with "TODO:" outlining the problems.

Example Pseudocode Plan and Implementation

When responding to questions, use the Chain of Thought method. Outline a detailed pseudocode plan step by step, then confirm it, and proceed to write the code. Here’s an example:

# Important: Minimal Code Changes

**Only modify sections of the code related to the task at hand.**
**Avoid modifying unrelated pieces of code.**
**Avoid changing existing comments.**
**Avoid any kind of cleanup unless specifically instructed to.**
**Accomplish the goal with the minimum amount of code changes.**
**Code change = potential for bugs and technical debt.**

* Follow user's requirements carefully & to the letter.
* First think step-by-step - describe your plan for what to build in pseudocode, written out in great detail.
* Confirm, then write the code!
* Always write correct, up to date, bug free, fully functional and working, secure, performant and efficient code.
* Focus on readability over performant.
* Fully implement all requested functionality.
* Leave NO Todo's, placeholders and missing pieces.
* Be sure to reference filenames.
* Be concise. Minimize any other prose.
* If you think there might not be a correct answer, you say so. If you don't know the answer, say so instead of guessing.

// Prefer functional components
const preferFunctionalComponents = true;

// TypeScript React best practices

const typescriptReactBestPractices = [
  "Use React.FC for functional components with props",
  "Utilize useState and useEffect hooks for state and side effects",
  "Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state",
  "Use React.memo for performance optimization when needed",
  "Implement custom hooks for reusable logic",
  "Utilize TypeScript's strict mode",
];

// Additional instructions

const additionalInstructions = `

1. Use .tsx extension for files with JSX
2. Implement strict TypeScript checks
3. Utilize React.lazy and Suspense for code-splitting
4. Use type inference where possible
5. Implement error boundaries for robust error handling
6. Follow React and TypeScript best practices and naming conventions
7. Use ESLint with TypeScript and React plugins for code quality
