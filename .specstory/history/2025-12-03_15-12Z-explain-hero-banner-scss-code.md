This code creates a 3D flying text animation for the hero banner. It breaks the text into 101 triangular pieces that animate independently.

## Overview
The `@for` loop (lines 27-90) generates styles for 101 child elements (0-100), each representing a triangular fragment of the text.

## Breakdown

**1. Loop and positioning (lines 27-30)**
- Iterates 0-100 to target each child
- Calculates which row each piece belongs to (20 pieces per row)

**2. Clip-path (lines 32-42)**
- Creates triangular shapes using `clip-path: polygon()`
- Each triangle covers a portion of the text
- Positions are calculated to tile the text area

**3. Transform origin (lines 43-52)**
- Sets a random rotation point for each piece
- Adds variation to the animation

**4. Animation setup (lines 53-59)**
- Each piece gets a unique animation (`fly1`, `fly2`, etc.)
- Duration: 5000ms
- Staggered delay: `$i * 40ms` (0ms, 40ms, 80ms, ...)
- Easing: `cubic-bezier(0.36, 0.1, 0.16, 1)`
- Infinite, alternating

**5. Keyframe animation (lines 61-88)**
- 0-10%: Hidden, rotated randomly in 3D space, far back on Z-axis
- 90-100%: Visible, rotated to 0°, at Z=0
- Creates a fly-in effect where pieces start scattered and rotate into place

## Visual Effect
The text appears to explode into 101 triangular fragments that fly in from random 3D positions and assemble into the final text, creating a 3D particle animation effect.
