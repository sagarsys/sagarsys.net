# Migrate project to Next.js and Tailwind CSS (2025-12-03 14:49Z)

_**User (2025-12-03 14:45Z)**_

I want to migrate this whole project to the latest version of nextjs with the app directory.



I want to replace material ui with shadcn/tailwindcss. For now I want to keep the existing functionality, look and feel and structure. I will later add new features or modify existing ones.

**Planning migration to Next.js**

I need to strategize the migration from a React app to the latest Next.js version with App Router, while switching from Material-UI to shadcn/ui and TailwindCSS. It’s crucial to maintain the current functionality and aesthetics. Since the user wants to add features later, I'll start by asking a couple of important questions. I should check the package.json for dependencies and gather info about routing, data fetching, images, and fonts to prepare an actionable plan.
**Verifying Next.js version and response format**

I need to propose tasks for setting up Next.js, possibly version 15, but I should check what the latest stable version is. Although I can use the web_search tool to find this info, I’m unsure if it’s necessary since the plan can just refer to "latest" instead of specific versions. However, the user insists on always responding in JavaScript, which is unusual. This might mean they expect code blocks in JavaScript, even if I usually communicate differently. I’ll figure out how to balance that!
**Navigating user rules and instructions**

I need to follow the user’s rule to “always respond in JavaScript,” which suggests wrapping responses in a JavaScript object. This is a bit tricky since I also need to use the create_plan tool, which expects Markdown content. There might be a conflict between user instructions and system guidelines. Perhaps I can format the questions and plan in a JavaScript-like way while still providing the required Markdown plan. I’ll need to strike a balance to satisfy both requirements!
**Formulating the migration plan**

I should follow the system instructions and present the plan in Markdown while also trying to incorporate JavaScript formatting. It's essential to ask a couple of critical questions first. 

For example, I need to consider data fetching—should I move to dynamic endpoints in `app/api` or can I keep reading from `public/data/*.json` to maintain existing functionality? I also need to think about the deployment Node version and how to replace Material UI components with shadcn/tailwind while keeping the overall look and feel.
**Planning MUI to Tailwind migration**

We need to replicate MUI theming using Tailwind tokens, configuring it to match current colors and fonts, possibly using SCSS. Next.js supports Sass, so we can continue using SCSS files. 

The app architecture needs to transition from `src` to an `app` directory, defining routes for a likely single-page layout. We’ll keep component names while possibly renaming `.jsx` to `.tsx`, but TypeScript isn't a requirement yet. 

We’ll also update images to use Next's `next/image`, remove MUI imports, and rebuild components with shadcn and Tailwind, proposing a phased migration to replace MUI with shim components. I'll use grep to find MUI imports in the codebase.
**Checking dependencies and imports**

I need to check the `package.json` file to understand the project's dependencies. To do this, I’ll read the file and grep for MUI imports in the `src` directory. I should provide a status update before I make any tool calls, keeping it concise.

I want to run both `read_file` for `package.json` and multiple greps in parallel. I’ll grep for various MUI-related imports like `@mui/`, `@material-ui/`, `ThemeProvider`, and `makeStyles`, while ensuring to limit the number of parallel tasks to 3-5. Let’s get started!</details></think>

---

I'll quickly scan dependencies and how much Material UI is used so I can size the migration and shape the plan accurately. Then I'll propose a concise phased plan for moving to Next.js App Router and shadcn/Tailwind while keeping the current look and structure.

**Evaluating Material-UI usage**

I’ve gotten some results regarding the project's dependencies. The `package.json` indicates it's using Material-UI v4, which is confirmed by no matches for `@mui/`. The grep on `@material-ui/` revealed 145 matches across 36 files, suggesting many components come from v4. However, searching for `ThemeProvider` and similar terms yielded no files found, which might indicate use of older names like `MuiThemeProvider`. It's curious since earlier results showed matches that contradict this. I need to look closer into that.
**Clarifying grep results**

I need to reevaluate my grep results. The first search for `ThemeProvider|createTheme|makeStyles|withStyles...` didn’t return any matches. However, an earlier grep for `@material-ui/` found 145 matches across 36 files. Then, there was another search that resulted in 61 matches across 29 files, but both searches are supposed to cover the same components. It's puzzling because the patterns contradict each other. I’ve made four tool calls: reading the `package.json` file, and three grep searches resulting in these mixed findings. Something isn’t adding up here.
**Analyzing MUI usage**

I see that there are 145 matches found across 36 files, and these files are listed. However, the grep for `ThemeProvider|createTheme|makeStyles|withStyles|styled\(|sx=` returned no matches, which is puzzling since MUI v4 typically uses `makeStyles`. It seems that styling may rely instead on SCSS, given the presence of `src/styles/*.scss` and `node-sass`. The grep for `import\s+.*from\s+['\"]@mui/material` also returned no matches, confirming that v5 imports aren’t being used. Nevertheless, `src/styles/materialUiTheme.js` appears relevant. This file could be important for a thoughtful analysis.
**Reviewing application structure**

I think I should read through `src/styles/materialUiTheme.js` to understand its purpose. It might be helpful to check `src/App.js` to get an overview of the app’s structure and layout. I’ll also look at `src/components/NavBar.jsx` to see how the navigation is organized. Additionally, I plan to read `index.js` to understand the root component and any theme provider usage. I’ll run the read_file command for these three files in parallel! That should give me a clearer picture.</details></think>

---

I found the dependencies and confirmed the project uses Material-UI v4 widely without theme APIs. I’ll open a few key files to understand the app structure and any theme provider usage before proposing the migration plan.

**Analyzing Theme Provider Usage**

I see that they do have an MUI theme provider, specifically using createTheme and responsiveFontSizes from '@material-ui/core/styles'. This contradicts the earlier grep for theme provider tokens, as my search didn't find any matches, even though App.js clearly uses ThemeProvider and createTheme. Maybe the grep command had issues with case sensitivity or parameters? It appears I included an incorrect "-i" parameter when it should be just "i". However, we've confirmed the theme provider and theme options exist. Now, I'll replicate the theme tokens for configuring the Tailwind theme.
**Checking Font Availability**

I noticed that in the public/fonts, there's a font called 'neuropol_nova_cnd_bold', but the theme specifies 'Titillium Web' and 'Play' as its fonts, which I can't find in the repo. They might be loaded through Google Fonts instead. I should verify if `public/index.html` contains a <link> to these fonts. It's important to check there to see how the fonts are being incorporated into the project. Let's take a look at `public/index.html`.</details></think>

**Inspecting CSS Usage**

I see that the project only includes Material Icons CSS, not the 'Titillium' fonts. This makes me think the fonts must be integrated into either `App.scss` or `index.css`. So, I should definitely check both `src/index.css` and `src/App.scss` to confirm where the fonts might be defined. Let’s explore that further to understand the setup better!</details></think>

**Drafting a plan for migration**

I need to create a step-by-step plan using the create_plan tool, which will include a title, overview, detailed steps, and possibly a short list of todos with IDs. First, I should ask one or two critical questions based on the plan_mode guidelines. 

One question could be whether the user wants to migrate to TypeScript, since shadcn and Next.js use it by default. Another question might be about preserving the CRA PWA/service worker, especially given the current setup isn’t being used in production. I’ll also consider the deployment target and the domain structure.
**Planning with the Next app router**

I'm organizing the transition to the Next app router, aiming for a single `page.js` structure with sections. We might consider using `next/image`, though it may not be necessary at this point. Adopting `next/font` for Titillium and Play is a good idea to avoid Flash Of Invisible Text (FOIT).

For styling, I’ll use both SCSS and Tailwind together. The shadcn installation will use CLI commands, and I plan to commit `components/ui/*` as local components. We’ll implement some MUI replacements, like creating a custom `Container` since shadcn lacks that. We'll also update imports manually, possibly using a codemod approach for efficiency, while continuing to fetch JSON data from our public directory.
**Structuring the Next.js app router**

In Next.js, I need to keep in mind that `page.js` is a server component by default, while our components will rely on client-side fetching with hooks. So, I'll designate top-level sections as client components by using `'use client'`. 

I plan to create `app/layout.js` with a theme provider. While we won't need the MUI theme, I might implement a `ThemeProvider` from `next-themes` for dark mode support. However, since the dark palette is currently enforced, I'll set the `html` class to `"dark"`.

For colors, replicating some values like `blueGrey[900]` into CSS variables makes sense. Considering the complexity of the migration, I’m proposing a two-step plan: first, migrating to Next.js while keeping Material-UI v4 operational, and then moving to shadcn/Tailwind. Although the user prefers replacing MUI now, I can suggest doing both steps in the same pull request as sequential commits. Alternatively, I could ask if they'd prefer a two-phase approach to reduce risk.
**Formulating critical questions**

I think I should ask the user a couple of important questions to guide the migration process. First, I want to know if they prefer a two-phase migration or a single-pass approach, as an all-in-one option can be heavy and risky. Since they initially expressed a desire to replace MUI with shadcn/Tailwind, they may be open to two phases.

The second question I need to ask is about adopting TypeScript. I can propose the defaults as a) two-phase migration and b) staying in JavaScript. Once I have their answers, I'll plan the next steps, but I need to stick to the guideline of asking these questions immediately. After that, I’ll use the create_plan tool once they respond.</details></think>

---

I reviewed the project: it’s CRA with Material‑UI v4 (ThemeProvider + dark theme), fonts loaded via `App.scss`, and many MUI components across `src/components/*`. I’m ready to propose the migration, but two quick choices will shape the plan:

1. Migration sequencing?
   - a) Two-phase: Next.js App Router first (keeping MUI), then replace MUI with shadcn/Tailwind
   - b) All‑in‑one: migrate to Next.js and replace MUI in the same pass

2. TypeScript adoption?
   - a) Stay in JavaScript (minimizes churn)
   - b) Adopt TypeScript (shadcn defaults to TS and improves DX)

Defaults: a), a).
