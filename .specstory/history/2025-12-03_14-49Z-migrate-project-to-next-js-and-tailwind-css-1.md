# Migrate project to Next.js and Tailwind CSS (2025-12-03 14:49Z)

_**User (2025-12-03 14:45Z)**_

I want to migrate this whole project to the latest version of nextjs with the app directory.



I want to replace material ui with shadcn/tailwindcss. For now I want to keep the existing functionality, look and feel and structure. I will later add new features or modify existing ones.

**Creating a migration plan**

The user is asking for a migration plan, but I have to follow specific guidelines: I can't modify files or use non-readonly tools, so I'll rely on tools like `read_file`, `codebase_search`, `grep`, and `web_search`. I need to ask one or two critical questions before putting together the plan. The user insists on responses in JavaScript but also expects markdown formatting with headings. I'll follow the higher-priority instruction, ensuring clarity while respecting the user’s preferences. It seems I can look at the `package.json` file to gather details about the current React version.
**Reading dependencies**

I'm planning to check the dependencies quickly, and I'll do that by using the `functions.read_file`. This approach should help me gather all the necessary information I need without making any modifications. I’m focusing on ensuring that I can read everything I need, so I'll keep it straightforward and efficient. I'll make sure to proceed carefully and respect the guidelines while reading through the file. It's all about getting it right for the user!</details></think>

**Planning the next steps**

I need to call `create_plan` at the end to ensure everything is organized. The plan should include headings and mention the main files. I should also consider adding optional todos for clarity. However, it’s important to ask clarifying questions first to ensure I’m on the right track. I want to make sure I capture everything needed in the plan without needing any edits once it’s created. Let’s get that right!</details></think>

1. Should the new Next.js app stay in plain JavaScript (matching the current CRA code), or do you want to take this opportunity to migrate to TypeScript?  
   - a) Stay with JavaScript  
   - b) Migrate to TypeScript  

2. For the initial migration, are you okay with setting up a fresh `next` app (e.g. in a new `next/` folder or replacing this one) and then moving components over, rather than incrementally converting this CRA app in place?  
   - a) Fresh Next app in this repo, then migrate code  
   - b) Convert the existing CRA app in-place to Next.js
