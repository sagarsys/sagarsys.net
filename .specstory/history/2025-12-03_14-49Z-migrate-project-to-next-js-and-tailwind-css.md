# Migrate project to Next.js and Tailwind CSS (2025-12-03 14:49Z)

_**User (2025-12-03 14:45Z)**_

I want to migrate this whole project to the latest version of nextjs with the app directory.



I want to replace material ui with shadcn/tailwindcss. For now I want to keep the existing functionality, look and feel and structure. I will later add new features or modify existing ones.

2. Component migration scope for this phase?

 - b) Fully replace every MUI component immediately`;
