## Overview

PubliSpeak is the first PDF document virtualization solution that is fully accessible (compliant with the WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards). It uses patented technology that extracts content from a standard PDF file to convert it into HTML support that fits any screen.

## Live Examples

- [Publicis Groupe - 2018 CSR Report](https://publicis-groupe.publispeak.com/2018-registration-document/page/C1/)
- [Airliquide - 2018 Annual report](https://airliquide.publispeak.com/2018-annual-report/page/C1/)
- [BNP Paribas - 2018 Integrated report](http://integrated-report.bnpparibas/2018/doc/article/C1/)
- [L'Oreal - 2019 Letter to shareholders](https://loreal-finance.publispeak.com/letter-to-shareholders-73/doc/article/1/)

## My Role

Together with a team of 3 developers and a CTO, our role was to migrate an older flash version of PubliSpeak to modern web technologies, accessible across multiple devices (screen sizes) and within accessibility standards. As a senior frontend developer, my task was to use CSS3 and Angular to make this work, while interacting with and integrating the backend APIs.

## Key Challenges

- **Accessibility First**: Due to accessibility requirements, we could not use existing plugins/libraries. This implied developing our own in-house libraries, such as an infinite scroll engine, a carousel, and others.

- **Multi-tenant Platform**: Each client could customize the platform to match their branding. I had to introduce CSS variables to change the look and feel of the whole platform.

- **Performance Optimization**: Some PDFs are 500+ pages long. The infinite scroll engine was responsible for switching between image representation to HTML view for pages in focus, with lazy loading of HTML chunks.

- **Fully Responsive Design**: Focus on UI/UX coupled with strict accessibility constraints.

- **Team Growth**: Formation and training of junior developers as the company expanded.

## Overview

Rework of a real-estate website for Kaufman & Broad, a publicly traded real estate development and construction company headquartered in France. Users can search for properties, learn about new opportunities & promos, and find useful information to guide them through their property acquisition journey.

## My Role

As the frontend lead in a team of four developers, my responsibilities included:

- Setup project architecture
- Automate developers' workflow using Gulp/webpack
- Establish development guidelines
- Analyze requirements & make time estimates
- Setup foundation for core project modules
- Ensure code meets standards through code reviews
- Train junior developers
- Liaise with backend to establish API contracts
- Liaise with UX designer to discuss feasibility
- Participate in client meetings & development

## Key Challenges

- Fast-paced client demands with changing requirements and design
- Integration of external service providers (e.g., 3D guided tours)
- Migration from legacy codebase with unrealistic client expectations
- Tight deadlines
- Cross-platform and cross-device considerations
- Onboarding and training newcomers to the project

## Overview

Desktop-based "mini-game" applications for interactive kiosks. Applications developed around data collection concept. Users participate in mini-games for a chance to win prizes while agreeing to submit data or answer survey questions. Collected data is extracted for marketing purposes.

## My Role

As a fullstack developer, I participated in the full lifecycle of the project - from design to deployment & support. Together with my frontend colleague, we chose the tech stack and developed a generic reusable library for quick application building.

Responsibilities:
- Full application development (frontend + backend)
- Remote deployment and testing on kiosks
- Live support and debugging
- Data export in CSV format

## Key Challenges

- **Remote Debugging**: Live support worldwide, working odd hours due to timezone differences
- **Tactile UI/UX**: No physical keyboard, designed emulated keyboard interface
- **Peripheral Devices**: Integration with printers, QR/barcode scanners
- **Admin Interface**: Hidden mechanism to access administration for debugging, reprinting tickets, exporting data
- **Deployment**: Standard process to build and deploy Electron app with required peripheral device drivers
- **Tight Deadlines**: Applications delivered for specific events (Christmas, festivals) with no room for delays
