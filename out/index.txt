## What Drives Me

Beyond writing code, I'm passionate about **discovering people, creativity, nature, conservation, healthy living, science, sustainability, renewable energy, and humanitarianism**. I believe technology should serve a greater purpose—which is why I'm excited about opportunities that align innovation with positive environmental impact.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me **hiking, exploring nature, art and culture, diving into psychology and quantum physics, or practicing yoga and mindfulness**. I enjoy sharing my photography with people to make them more conscious of the beauty of nature, in the hope that they protect it for ourselves and future generations. **#SaveSoil**

## Overview

PubliSpeak is the first PDF document virtualization solution that is fully
accessible (compliant with the WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards). It uses
patented technology that extracts content from a standard PDF file to convert it
into HTML support that fits any screen.

## Live Examples

-   [Publicis Groupe - 2018 CSR Report](https://publicis-groupe.publispeak.com/2018-registration-document/page/C1/)
-   [Airliquide - 2018 Annual report](https://airliquide.publispeak.com/2018-annual-report/page/C1/)
-   [BNP Paribas - 2018 Integrated report](http://integrated-report.bnpparibas/2018/doc/article/C1/)
-   [L'Oreal - 2019 Letter to shareholders](https://loreal-finance.publispeak.com/letter-to-shareholders-73/doc/article/1/)

## My Role

Together with a team of 3 developers and a CTO, our role was to migrate an older
flash version of PubliSpeak to modern web technologies, accessible across
multiple devices (screen sizes) and within accessibility standards. As a senior
frontend developer, my task was to use CSS3 and Angular to make this work, while
interacting with and integrating the backend APIs.

## Key Challenges

-   **Accessibility First**: Due to accessibility requirements, we could not use
    existing plugins/libraries. This implied developing our own in-house
    libraries, such as an infinite scroll engine, a carousel, and others.

-   **Multi-tenant Platform**: Each client could customize the platform to match
    their branding. I had to introduce CSS variables to change the look and feel
    of the whole platform.

-   **Performance Optimization**: Some PDFs are 500+ pages long. The infinite
    scroll engine was responsible for switching between image representation to
    HTML view for pages in focus, with lazy loading of HTML chunks.

-   **Fully Responsive Design**: Focus on UI/UX coupled with strict
    accessibility constraints.

-   **Team Growth**: Formation and training of junior developers as the company
    expanded.

## Overview

Rework of a real-estate website for Kaufman & Broad, a publicly traded real
estate development and construction company headquartered in France. Users can
search for properties, learn about new opportunities & promos, and find useful
information to guide them through their property acquisition journey.

## My Role

As the frontend lead in a team of four developers, my responsibilities included:

-   Setup project architecture
-   Automate developers' workflow using Gulp/webpack
-   Establish development guidelines
-   Analyze requirements & make time estimates
-   Setup foundation for core project modules
-   Ensure code meets standards through code reviews
-   Train junior developers
-   Liaise with backend to establish API contracts
-   Liaise with UX designer to discuss feasibility
-   Participate in client meetings & development

## Key Challenges

-   Fast-paced client demands with changing requirements and design
-   Integration of external service providers (e.g., 3D guided tours)
-   Migration from legacy codebase with unrealistic client expectations
-   Tight deadlines
-   Cross-platform and cross-device considerations
-   Onboarding and training newcomers to the project

## Overview

Desktop-based "mini-game" applications for interactive kiosks. Applications
developed around data collection concept. Users participate in mini-games for a
chance to win prizes while agreeing to submit data or answer survey questions.
Collected data is extracted for marketing purposes.

## My Role

As a fullstack developer, I participated in the full lifecycle of the project -
from design to deployment & support. Together with my frontend colleague, we
chose the tech stack and developed a generic reusable library for quick
application building.

Responsibilities:

-   Full application development (frontend + backend)
-   Remote deployment and testing on kiosks
-   Live support and debugging
-   Data export in CSV format

## Key Challenges

-   **Remote Debugging**: Live support worldwide, working odd hours due to
    timezone differences
-   **Tactile UI/UX**: No physical keyboard, designed emulated keyboard
    interface
-   **Peripheral Devices**: Integration with printers, QR/barcode scanners
-   **Admin Interface**: Hidden mechanism to access administration for
    debugging, reprinting tickets, exporting data
-   **Deployment**: Standard process to build and deploy Electron app with
    required peripheral device drivers
-   **Tight Deadlines**: Applications delivered for specific events (Christmas,
    festivals) with no room for delays
